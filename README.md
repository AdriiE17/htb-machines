# HTB MACHINES SEARCHER
This project is a personal modified project originally made by s4vitar on his course "Introducci√≥n a Linux" which can be found on his website [Hack4u](https://hack4u.io/). 
The project is a basic script that takes the contents of a file from the website [HTB Machines - search engine](https://htbmachines.github.io/) and then using several flags can find hack the box machines with some given properties 
or show the properties for a given machine name. Furthermore, each machine includes its resolution in video format that can be found on s4vitar's secondary youtube channel [s4viOnLive](https://www.youtube.com/@S4viOnLive).

Once installed the project by just cloning the repository, type the following to see the help panel:

```bash

./htb-machines -h

```
